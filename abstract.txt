Dylan Waters
Final Project Abstract

For my final project, I wish thinking of modeling a simple island, having the
camera rotate around the island. I was thinking of having a tree and maybe some
other scenery, such as a beach ball or treasure chest, with a possible small
animation with these objects. Then, in the back ground,birds will fly around.
All the models will use textures.

The water will be animated with ripples and this will probably take the longest
time of the project.
